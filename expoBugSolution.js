Debugging this error requires a systematic approach:

1. **Check for Typos in Config Files:**  Carefully review `app.json` and `package.json` for any typos or syntax errors.  These small mistakes can significantly impact Expo's build process.
2. **Clean the Project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall all packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.  This can often resolve dependency conflicts.
3. **Examine the Full Error Log:**  The cryptic error message might be hiding a more helpful error deep within the log output. Carefully scrutinize the entire output from `expo start` for more specific details.
4. **Simplify the Project:** If you're working on a complex project, temporarily remove non-essential components to isolate potential causes. This includes testing with a minimal setup.
5. **Check the Expo SDK Version:** Ensure the specified Expo SDK version in your `package.json` is compatible with your other dependencies and the Expo CLI version.
6. **Update Dependencies:** Outdated packages can create compatibility issues. Update to the latest versions of your dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
7. **Environment Variables:** If you are using environment variables for APIs or settings, double-check that they are correctly set.
8. **Simulator/Emulator Issues:** Restart your simulator or emulator. Sometimes a reset can clear up underlying problems.
9. **Expo CLI Update:** Make sure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI installed.  Run `expo update` or `npm update -g expo-cli`.
10. **Check Native Modules:** If you are using any custom native modules, verify they are correctly configured and built.
