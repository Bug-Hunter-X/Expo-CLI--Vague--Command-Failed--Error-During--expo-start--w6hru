This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo start` command, particularly when dealing with complex projects or those with numerous dependencies.  The error message itself might not be directly helpful, often indicating a general failure in the build process without pinpointing the exact cause. This can be frustrating because it provides minimal debugging information.  It might manifest as a completely blank console, or a vague error like "Error: Command failed: ..." with a long, cryptic stack trace.  Underlying causes are often related to incorrect configuration files, dependency conflicts, issues with native modules, or problems with the underlying environment.
